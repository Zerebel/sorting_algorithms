## Introduction

In this repository, you will find the implementation of different sorting algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file and includes a brief explanation of how it works.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Feel free to explore each algorithm's implementation and understand how they work.

## Usage

To use any of the sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zerebel/sorting_algorithms.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd sorting_algorithms`
3. Choose the algorithm you want to use and open its corresponding file.
4. Copy the code and use it in your own project.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional sorting algorithms to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows the existing code style and includes appropriate tests.
